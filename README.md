# playground-release-drafter-and-gh-pages
Playground for github pages, AsciDoctor and release-drafter actions



## AsciiDoctor and GitHub Pages

### AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoctor sources are located in the [docs](docs)
They are used to generate the static site which is then pushed to the `gh-pages` branch
The site is hosted on https://tbouffard.github.io/playground-release-drafter-and-gh-pages/ 

Doc generation
```
docker run -v "$(pwd)/docs:/documents/" -v "$(pwd)/docs-generated:/documents-generated/" --name asciidoc-to-html \
asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor  asciidoctor -D /documents-generated index.adoc
```

### GitHub Pages

The asciidoctor sources are processed then pushed to the `gh-pages` by a [dedicated workflow](.github/workflows/gh-pages-publishing.yml)
Another workflow is also available to check build page status (TODO: to be fixed as it seems not running for now)


## Release-Drafter

Q&A (info based on the `GitHub Action` usage)
- can I update the draft release manually (for instance, overview in the top of the content): **NO**, or at least not found how to do
- is the release content is rebuilt on each run: **YES**, tested by removing the whole content manually or by activating the
action after some PR have already been merged
- categories from label - **not found how to or if this can be configured**
  - require several labels to be added in a category
  - exclude labels combinaison: for instance, PR marked as `enhancement` and `documentation` only referenced in the `enhancement`
  category and not in the `documentation`
